// Will create new structs for documents with attributes like author, source, title
// Documents return a type, so that individual fields can be added to capture structured info (e.g. a salary field for a job description)
// Documents can be created from files (and create all in a directory)
// Some functioanlity to ensure not duplicate documents are created?
// Documents will own all their content, so other analyses can slices instead of duplicating strings
// That will mean to rewrite some of the content analysis section
